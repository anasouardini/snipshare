# SnipShare - code snippets sharing app

## The General Idea

I started this project with the intention of learning OAuth 2.0, but it turned out that I ended up learning much more than just that. The idea evolved during the process of building it, and I found myself liking the new direction it took. As a result, I decided to invest more time into its development.
