# Scrapyard project

## The Idea of It

The idea of this projec is people can share snippets of code of code between with other people.

The snippet can be either public or private. if it's public everyone can see it, and if it's private not everyone can see yet, only the admin if the app and users you choose to give them read access to your snippet.

Reading isn't the only option, you can also give others permission to edit your snippet for example or even delete it if you choose so.

## The Goal Behind It

the reason behind this little project is to practice Auth, so I though it would be fun to make it programming related.

## The Added Benifit

the main Benifit obviously is to learn how to do Auth. but I also changed a few thing in my workflow. so I'll be learning other thing as well.

- Vite (comming from webpack)
- Tailwind (comming from Sass)
- Passportjs (comming from no Auth îŽ•)
- React-Location (comming from React-Router)
- Mysql2 (comming from Prisma)
