# SnipShare project (this project is barely usable right now)

## The General Idea

I started this project just to learn OAuth2.0, and I endedup learning more than that, because the idea have changed in the process of making it and then I liked it and wanted to spend more time building it.

The idea of this project is that users can share snippets of code with each other. I see it as npm but for snippets, or if the idea developed further I would describe it as another coding copilot except without a pilot(AI). It would be community driven.

## Features

- Users can create a snippet that is used often
- The snippet can be categorized by language and purpose
- Other users may search for a snippet by name and use it
- other users can be allowed to have access to your account or a specific snippet

The back-end is separate from the front-end so it can be used with any client like an IDE.

## Tools Used In This Project

- react-query
- React-Location & React-Router
- react-icons
- Tailwind
- Monaco Editor

- Passportjs & JWT
- google OAuth2.0 manually
- notification system with SSE
- ZOD
- Mysql2

- Vite
- NeoVim

## Further Improvements

- add compatibility with vscode and neovim to make the process easier
