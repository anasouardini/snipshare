# Scrapyard project

## The Idea of It

The idea of this project is that devs can share snippets of code with each other.

Reading isn't the only option, you can also give others permission to edit your snippet or even delete it.

## The Goal Behind It

The reason behind this little project is to practice using Authentication and authorization tools and best practices, I though that a project a about sharing code snippets would be ideal for that.

## Things I've learned throughout the process

The main Benefit obviously is to learn how to do Authentication and Authorization.
But I've also changed a few thing in my workflow, so I also learned other things in the process as well.

- Tailwind (coming from Sass)
Other than the very long line that's trying to break out of my monitor... Tailwind is so clean and makes me style things faster.

- Passportjs & JWT (coming from no Auth :upside_down_face: )
I've learned a lot about OAuth, probably more than I need to learn. But I think it's going to help some day.

- React-Location (coming from React-Router)
React-location is not easy to work with, I sill prefer the jsx syntax of react-router.

- Mysql2 (coming from Prisma)
I still think that Prisma is the best thing that has happened to Sql. But in this project... I think it's overkill, especially with the 100ms overhead for each query.

- google OAuth2.0 manually 
turns out passportjs is nothing but an overhead in the authentication implementation.

- ZOD
I still need more time using this tool, but it's a good way to get the job done with minimal keystrokes.

- Monaco Editor 
Faced some issues implementing this one, and still haven't figured out how to make it behave as I want.

- debouncing
Debouncing is one way to evade wasting cpu cycles for intermediate iterations that are not really that necessary.

- react-query
When I imported react-query I realized that I was doing so many things from scratch.

- Vite (coming from Webpack)
As long as I ditch Webpack, anything is good at this stage.

- NeoVim
I'm still stuck with the overhead of setting it up. auto completion, smart tabulation, jsx highlighting and other stuff are very annoying to setup.
But I feel like I'm going fast when it comes to the text/code editing phase.
