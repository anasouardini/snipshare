# Scrapyard project

## The Idea of It

The idea of this projec is people can share snippets of code of code between with other people.

The snippet can be either public or private. if it's public everyone can see it, and if it's private not everyone can see yet, only the admin if the app and users you choose to give them read access to your snippet.

Reading isn't the only option, you can also give others permission to edit your snippet for example or even delete it if you choose so.

## The Goal Behind It

the reason behind this little project is to practice using Authentication and athorization tools and best practices, I though that a project a about sharing code snippets would be ideal for that.

## Things I've learned throughout the process

the main Benifit obviously is to learn how to do Authentication and Authorization.
but I've also changed a few thing in my workflow, so I also learned other things in the process as well.

- Tailwind (comming from Sass)
Other than the very long line that's trying to break out of my monitor... Tailwind is so clean and makes me style things faster.

- Passportjs & JWT (comming from no Auth :upside_down_face: )
I've learned a lot about OAuth, probably more than I need to learn. but I think it's going to help some day.

- React-Location (comming from React-Router)
React-location is not easy to work with, I sill prefer the jsx syntax of react-router.

- Mysql2 (comming from Prisma)
I still think that prisma is the best thing that has happend to sql. but in this project... I think it's overkill.

- google OAuth2.0 manually 
turns out passportjs is nothing but an overhead in the authentication implementation.

- ZOD
I still need more time using this tool, but it's a good way to the job done with minimal keystrokes.

- monaco editor 
Faced some issues implementing this one, and still havn't figured out how to make it behave as I want.

- debouncing
Debouncing is one way to evade wasting cpu cycles for intermediate iterations that are not really that neccessary.

- react-query
When I imported react-query I realized that I was doing many things from scratch.

- Vite (comming from webpack)
As long as I ditch webpack, anything is good at this stage.

- NeoVim
I'm still stuck with the overhead of setting it up. autocomletion, smart tabulation, jsx highlighting and other stuff are very annoying to setup.
But I feel like I'm going fast when it comes to the text/code editting phase.
